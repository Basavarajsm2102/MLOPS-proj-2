üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Project Template Setup

Execute the template.py file to create the project structure for vehicle insurance prediction.  python template.py

This sets up the necessary directories and files. üìÇ


2. Package Configuration

Write code in setup.py and pyproject.toml to enable importing local packages.
Refer to crashcourse.txt for detailed guidance on configuring setup.py and pyproject.toml.üìñ Note: Ensure all dependencies and metadata are correctly specified.


3. Virtual Environment Setup

Create and activate a Conda virtual environment named vehicle with Python 3.10:conda create -n vehicle python=3.10 -y
conda activate vehicle


Add required modules to requirements.txt.
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

üêç This ensures a clean, isolated environment for the project.


4. Verify Installed Packages

Run the following command to confirm that local packages are installed:pip list

üîç Check the terminal output to verify all dependencies, including local packages.


5. MongoDB Atlas Setup

Sign up for MongoDB Atlas.
Create a new project by providing a project name, then proceed with default settings (Next > Next > Create).üåê This sets up your MongoDB cloud environment for storing insurance data.


6. MongoDB Cluster Creation

From the Create a Cluster screen, select the M0 service (free tier) and keep other settings as default.
Click Create Deployment to initialize the cluster.‚òÅÔ∏è Your MongoDB cluster is now ready!


7. Database User Setup

Set up a username and password for the database.
Create a Database User in MongoDB Atlas.üîê Ensure secure credentials for database access.


8. Network Access Configuration

Navigate to Network Access in MongoDB Atlas.
Add the IP address 0.0.0.0/0 to allow access from anywhere.üåç This enables flexible connectivity to your database.


9. MongoDB Connection String

Go to your project in MongoDB Atlas.
Click Get Connection String > Drivers.
Select Driver: Python, Version: 3.6 or later.
Copy the connection string, replace the <password> placeholder with your actual password, and save it securely.üîó Example: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/...


10. Notebook Setup

Create a folder named notebook in the project directory.
Proceed to step 11 to create the notebook file and configure the kernel.


11. Dataset Integration

Add the vehicle insurance dataset to the notebook folder.
Ensure the dataset is accessible for use in the notebook.üìä The dataset will be used for MongoDB operations and model training.


12. Push Data to MongoDB

Create a file named mongoDB_demo.ipynb in the notebook folder.
Select the kernel: Python Kernel > vehicle.
Write code in the notebook to push the vehicle insurance dataset to the MongoDB database.üì§ This uploads your data to MongoDB Atlas.


13. Verify Data in MongoDB

Go to MongoDB Atlas > Database > Browse Collections.
Verify that your vehicle insurance data is stored in key-value format.‚úÖ Confirm successful data ingestion.


14. Logging Setup

Write a logging module and save it as a logger file.
Test the logging functionality in demo.py.üìú This ensures proper logging for debugging and monitoring.


15. Exception Handling

Write an exception handling module and save it as an exception file.
Test the exception handling in demo.py.‚ö†Ô∏è This improves the robustness of your application.


16. EDA and Feature Engineering

Add notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering in the notebook folder.üìà These notebooks analyze and preprocess the vehicle insurance dataset.


17. Data Ingestion Component

Declare variables in constants.__init__.py.
Add code to configuration.mongo_db_connections.py to define a function for MongoDB connection.
In the data_access folder, add code to proj1_data.py to:
Connect to the database using mongo_db_connections.py.
Fetch vehicle insurance data in key-value format and transform it into a DataFrame.


Add code to entity.config_entity.py up to the DataIngestionConfig class.
Add code to entity.artifact_entity.py up to the DataIngestionArtifact class.
Add code to components.data_ingestion.py.
Add code to the training pipeline.
Run demo.py (ensure MongoDB connection URL is set, see step 18).üîÑ This sets up the data ingestion pipeline for insurance data.


18. MongoDB Connection URL Setup

Set the MongoDB connection URL as an environment variable.
For Bash (macOS/Linux):export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>..."
echo $MONGODB_URL


For PowerShell (Windows):$env:MONGODB_URL = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>..."
echo $env:MONGODB_URL


For Windows (via System Settings):
Open Environment Variables settings.
Add a new variable: Name: MONGODB_URL, Value: <url>.


Add the artifact directory to .gitignore.üîí This secures the MongoDB connection.


19. Data Validation Utilities

Complete the code in utils.main_utils.py.
Add dataset schema information to config.schema.yaml for the data validation step.üõ°Ô∏è This ensures the integrity of the vehicle insurance data.


20. Data Validation Component

Follow the same workflow as step 17 to implement the Data Validation component.‚úÖ Validates the ingested insurance data against the schema.


21. Data Transformation Component

Follow the same workflow as step 17 to implement the Data Transformation component.
Add estimator.py to the entity folder.üîß Prepares insurance data for model training.


22. Model Trainer Component

Follow the same workflow as step 17 to implement the Model Trainer component.
Add relevant classes to estimator.py in the entity folder.ü§ñ Trains the machine learning model for insurance prediction.


23. AWS Services Setup

Log in to the AWS Console and set the region to us-east-1.
Go to IAM > Create New User:
Name: firstproj.
Attach policy: AdministratorAccess.
Create the user.


Go to the user > Security Credentials > Access Keys > Create Access Key:
Select CLI, agree to conditions, and download the .csv file.


Set environment variables using the .csv values:
Bash:export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY


PowerShell:$env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
$env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
echo $env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo $env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY




Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and region name to constants.__init__.py.
Add code to src.configuration.aws_connection.py for AWS S3 service integration.
Ensure the following in constants.__init__.py:MODEL_EVALUATION_CHANGED_THRESHOLD_SCORE: float = 0.02
MODEL_BUCKET_NAME = "my-model-mlopsproj"
MODEL_PUSHER_S3_KEY = "model-registry"


Go to S3 > Create Bucket:
Region: us-east-1.
Bucket Name: my-model-mlopsproj.
Uncheck Block all public access and acknowledge.
Create the bucket.


Add code to src.aws_storage for pulling and pushing models to the S3 bucket.
Create s3_estimator.py in the entity directory with functions for S3 model operations.‚òÅÔ∏è Sets up AWS integration for model storage.


24. Model Evaluation and Pusher

Implement the Model Evaluation and Model Pusher components.üìä Evaluates the insurance prediction model and deploys it to production.


25. Prediction Pipeline and App Setup

Create the code structure for the Prediction Pipeline.
Set up app.py for the vehicle insurance prediction application.üåê Prepares the app for predictions.


26. Static and Template Directories

Add static and template directories to the project.üé® These hold CSS, JavaScript, and HTML templates for the app.


27. CI-CD Setup

Create Dockerfile and .dockerignore files.
Create .github/workflows directory and add aws.yaml for CI-CD configuration.
In AWS Console, create a new IAM user:
Name: usvisa-user.
Attach AdministratorAccess policy.
Go to Security Credentials > Access Keys > Create Access Key > CLI > Download .csv.


Create an ECR Repository:
Go to ECR > Region: us-east-1 > Create Repository.

Save the rules.üåê Opens the port for application access.


33. Access the Application

Paste the EC2 instance's public IP address followed by :5080 in your browser (e.g., http://<public-ip>:5080).
The vehicle insurance prediction application should now be accessible.üéâ Your app is live!


34. Model Training Route

Access the model training functionality via the /training route (e.g., http://<public-ip>:5080/training).üß† Triggers model training for insurance predictions.


üì¢ Notes

Ensure all environment variables (MongoDB URL, AWS credentials) are set correctly to avoid connection issues.
Regularly check MongoDB Atlas and AWS Console for resource usage and security settings.
Monitor the GitHub Actions runner status to ensure the CI-CD pipeline runs smoothly.
The dataset used in this project is specific to vehicle insurance prediction; ensure it is properly formatted and validated.

Happy predicting! üöóüí∏
